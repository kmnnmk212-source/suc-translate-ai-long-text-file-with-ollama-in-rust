Book Translator

A platform for translating books and large text documents.

Two-step process. For better quality.

The tool processes text files using Ollama LLM models with a two-stage approach: primary translation followed by AI self-reflection and refinement for better results. Suitable for translators, publishers, authors, researchers and content creators who need to translate large text documents.
Support for multiple languages including English, Russian, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. Genre-specific modes (fiction, technical, academic, business, poetry), real-time translation progress tracking for both stages, translation history and status monitoring, automatic error recovery and retry mechanisms, and multi-format export (TXT, PDF, EPUB).
